Overview

This project involves the development of two .NET applications using MongoDB as the database, RabbitMQ as the message broker, and gRPC for inter-application communication. The applications are containerized with Docker and can be deployed on Kubernetes. A load balancer directs traffic to the respective APIs of each application.

Components

DataCatalogService: 
Command Service: 
MongoDB: Database for storing data. 
RabbitMQ: Message broker for asynchronous communication. 
GRPC

gRPC facilitates communication between the two applications.
